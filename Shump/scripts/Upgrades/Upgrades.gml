/*
Step 3: Applying Upgrades

The player object (or a game manager) can hold a list of acquired upgrades.

// player create event
upgrades = [];
damage = 5;
fire_rate = 1.0; // lower = faster
lives = 3;
shoot_mode = "normal";

When picking an upgrade:
/// player_get_upgrade(index)
var upg = global.upgrade_pool[index];
array_push(upgrades, upg);
upg.apply(self);

Step 5: Optional â€” Categories & Random Selection

Use an enum or string category to sort upgrades (offense, defense, utility, special).
Then when presenting choices, pick randomly from the pool by category.
